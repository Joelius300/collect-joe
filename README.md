# Collect-Joe

A WinForms "game" named Collect-Joe I made for school a long time ago (dates back to May 18). I like to put old things up for the memories and also be able to see the progress I've made since then.  
Futhermore I find it really interesting to see how I approached problems back when I started to learn how to code. This also helps me to teach other people code by better understanding what they might be thinking.

It's another one of those ancient projects of mine that I just upload now for the sake of having it archived. So as you would expect, the code is horrible. Also there are some super corny eastereggs.
